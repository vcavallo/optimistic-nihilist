This blog is maintained by [Vinney Cavallo](http://vinneycavallo.com) - hereafter 
to be referred to as `me` or `I`.  

I've been wanting a place to dump medium-to-long-form introspective writing for a 
little while. There are many different topics I'm interested in exploring and one of 
the barriers that stopped me from setting up a site like this in the past was 
one of those [Hard Things](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html) - naming.  

If I had to give a singular name/url to a blog - one that wasn't just going to be my 
name - I wanted it to at least nearly summarize either a core thought of mine or the 
material that would make up the blog.  

Recently I described myself to someone as an 
_Optimistic Nihilist_ and it felt like it really fit properly. For reasons explained 
elsewhere on this site (depending on at what point in time you read this sentence) I 
am deeply convinced that "meaning" is a nonsense topic [link TK] but 99% of the time 
that idea doesn't get me down at all. In fact, my knee-jerk reaction to that thought 
is to smile and laugh - it's absolutely hilarious that we are bizarre, self-aware piles 
of biological complexity! I strive to enjoy that bare fact as much as I can. It makes 
no sense that we can feel feelings anyway, but it makes even less sense to feel bad about it.
